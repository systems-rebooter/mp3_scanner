mp3_scanner
===========

check md5sum and bitrate of all mp3 in a given path

needs python-mutagen


EXAMPLES
========

to find duplicated mp3:
for i in $(python mp3_bitrate.py ~/ |awk -F ';' '{print $3}'); do echo $i; done| sort | uniq -cd

find corrupted mp3s
python mp3_bitrate.py ~/ | grep corrupted

it's always annoying
